--v.097 - Fifth Public Release

- Fixed bug when going into combat with no mainhand weapon equipped (and offered a 'polite'
suggestion for those cases)

- Fixed lua errors related to not having any trinkets equipped.

- Paranoia checking included. Default is 20%, and can be put up or down in 5% increments 
via use of /lzt increment and /lzt decrement. Order of paranoia is this: Use Lifegiving Gem
(if equipped), then use Last Stand (if known), then use Shield Wall, then use a Healthstone,
then use a Major Healing Potion. Yes, it's coded that way on purpose, I think it's better
to use timers before consumables. There is a 2 second choke between paranoia triggered
abilities to give the healers a chance to get you back up and preserve your skills and items
when they might not be needed.

--v.0961 - Bug Fix Release

- Rage Dump toggle was actually turning off Demoralizing Shout instead of the Rage dump. 
Copy/Paste ftl.

--v.096 - Fourth Public Release

- Heroic Strike Rage Dump toggle added. When turned on, if over 60 rage, it will use Heroric
Strike in order to drop rage as quickly as possible. When off, it will proceed as normal.
Command is /lzt dump on|off

- Bug fix for spell and action slot ID's not getting updated properly when using the keybinding
to fire off LazyTank (major oversight on my part, mea culpa)

- Sunder Armor expiration warning dropped. There is simply no way to tell when a Sunder 
Armor has hit after the 5th one is applied, and as such, there is no way to restart a 30
second timer to warn of the expiration. You can tell if it misses, gets dodged, or parried
and and short circuit a timer reset based on that, but it's an awful lot of work for a very
small feature. It'll be much easier to do in the expansion when Devastate is made available,
and as such, the warning expiration will not be implemented until then, and will simply
not be available to tanks who are not deep-Protection. I *might* code it as a seperate mod,
but it won't be part of LazyTank anytime soon.

--v.0951 - Bug Fix Release

- Auto Attack issues should be resolved, thanks to Axium for pointing it out. In order to
ensure Auto Attack is properly toggled on, the Attack icon from your spellbook must be 
somewhere on your action bar, though not necessarily have a keybinding assigned to it. Also,
if you have your mainhand weapon on your action bars anywhere (for swapping and the like)
take it off, otherwise LazyTank will try to Equip/Unequip your mainhand. 

--v.095 - Third Public Release

- Commandline Options have changed, READ THE DOCUMENTATION.

- Fixed ThreatMeter compatibility. Promise. Typo's ftl.

- Bloodrage toggle added in. When enabled, if you are about 50% health and Bloodrage is
available, LazyTank will automatically use it.

- Documentation rewritten to hopefully provide a little more clarity for the non-nerd minded


--v0.94 - Second Public Release

- Updated TOC for 1.12

- 5 Second/Ready notificatio for Berserker Rage if you use it via the fear break routine (no
warning if you use the spell manually)

- Instituted rage dump, if over 60 rage, will spam Heroic Strike until under 60
rage.

- Changed Shield Block routine to not cast unless there's enough rage left for Revenge
afterwards. 

- KLT Threat Meter Compabtibility. If it's installed, it will detect it and send the correct
script command, otherwise it'll cast Sunder as normal.

- Streamlined Rage usage a bit. Basically, every other skill will always make sure there will be enough rage left over for Revenge. If it can't do anything else, it'll make sure
autoattack is turned on.

- Made the mod a little less spammy for stuff like 'I can't do that yet' and 'I'm out of rage'. Basically, checked to make sure a skill was actually available before trying to do it. Doesn't eliminate spam entirely, but does cut down on it.

- Removed saving of the Spell and Action ID #'s. This was messing with folks who moved around their buttons or installed something like Discord Action Bars after they installed LazyTank. Instead, LazyTank will generate the action and spell ID's the first time any kind of command is used via /lzt. What this means is that everytime your spell or action ID's change, reload the UI or else LazyTank will be looking at the wrong numbers. You will also probably need to reload the UI each time you respec. I'll work on finding events that will trigger the generation automatically that will remove this need, but for now, deal with it. (This was actually changed in 0.94, I just forgot to add it to the changelog)
